Overview
You need to set up a virtual machine (VM) with specific security settings and configurations. Hereâ€™s how to tackle each part:


SSH Configuration:
SSH Port: Set SSH to run only on port 4242.
No Root SSH Login: Prevent root from logging in via SSH.


Firewall Setup (UFW):
Install UFW: Use DNF to install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on CentOS.
Configure UFW: Allow only port 4242 for SSH and block all other ports.


Hostname Configuration:
Set Hostname: Change your VM's hostname to include your login ending with "42" (e.g., wil42).


Password Policy:
Password Expiration: Set passwords to expire every 30 days.
Minimum Days: Set a minimum of 2 days before a password can be changed.
Warning: Provide a 7-day warning before passwords expire.
Password Requirements:
At least 10 characters.
Must include an uppercase letter and a number.
No more than 3 consecutive identical characters.
Must not include the username.
Root Password: Should comply with the above policy, but with additional rules.


User and Groups:
User Creation: Create a user with your login name.
Groups: Add this user to user42 and sudo groups.

Sudo Configuration:
Password Attempts: Limit to 3 incorrect password attempts.
Custom Error Message: Display a custom message for incorrect sudo password attempts.
Logging: Archive sudo actions (input and output) to /var/log/sudo/.
TTY Mode: Enable TTY mode for sudo. [must exit a human interaction]
Path Restriction: Restrict sudo to specific paths (e.g., /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin).

// Start A New Task With Bash

[1]: Create a script: Write a bash script named monitoring.sh.
	--- "https://youtu.be/tK9Oc6AEnR4?si=_i8E-ABKRYCctmEQ"
[2]: Gather information: Use commands in the script to collect:
/*
	OS architecture and kernel version
	Number of physical processors
	Number of virtual processors
	Current available RAM and its utilization rate
	Current available memory and its utilization rate
	Current CPU utilization rate
	Date and time of the last reboot
	Whether LVM is active
	Number of active connections
	Number of users on the server
	IPv4 address and MAC address
	Number of sudo commands executed
	Display information: Use the wall command to send this information to all terminal sessions.
*/
[3]: Schedule the script: Set the script to run every 10 minutes at server startup. || 
	--- use cron to run it every 10 minutes with wall.
	--- cat /etc/crontab --> more information
[4]: Ensure no errors are visible: Make sure the script runs without showing errors to the users.
[5]: Interrupt: Stop it without modifying the script. [kill || stopping the cron job that executes it].
